Wow, Day 5 is done!

Thank you for participating in the first run of the course.

Now that you've experienced the format of #Sketch5, what are your thoughts? If you have anything to share, I'd love to hear from you.

I'm also open to suggestions for new content you would like to learn about in the future (perspective? buildings? portraits?). Right now I spend most of my time working on Pixel Art Academy (http://pixelart.academy/?utm_source=sketch5&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sketch5), but I want to take time for pencil sketching as well. In fact, sketching will be one part of Pixel Art Academy itself (a side quest)!

Finally, you can restart the course (you will receive the same content) by simply sending another email with the subject "sign up".

I hope you had a great time.

Matej
