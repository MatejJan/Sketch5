Welcome back,

It's second day of #Sketch5!

Steps to do:
1. Put a star/flag on this email so you'll have it easily accessible when you sit down at your location.
2. When you're done with the 5-minute exercise, reply to this email with the word "done" in the first line of the reply.
3. Optionally include any feedback, questions, or a photo of your sketch.

As a reminder, here's what will happen next:
1. I will read your email.
2. I will automatically send you a confirmation if you say "done" at the start of the email.
3. I will reply to any questions when I get the chance.
4. I will follow up with new instructions the next day.

Enjoy your day!

Cheers,
Matej
