Hi there,

It's time for your first day of #Sketch5. Let's dive right in!

By now you should have:
1. Chosen an outside location that you will pass at least a couple of times a week as part of your usual routine.
2. Set a reminder that will make sure you do the 30 seconds + celebration task for the first time. Remember, you don't have to draw. Celebrate just for remembering to sit down. After that you will repeat this every time you pass that location (without a reminder). Celebrating will make your brain want to do it again automatically after you repeat it a few times.

I also want you to put a star/flag on this email so you'll have it easily accessible when your reminder goes off at the chosen location.

The attached image includes instructions for Day 1 of the course. When you've completed the 5-minute exercise, do this:
1. Reply to this email with the word "done" in the first line of the reply.
2. Optionally you can include anything you want to tell me (how it went) or any questions you have. You are encouraged to attach an image if you want to share what you sketched with me.

What happens next?
1. I will read the email you send (I manually check everything you send to sketch5@retronator.com).
2. I will automatically send you a confirmation if you included the words "done" in the email.
3. I will reply to any questions you have in a separate email when I get the chance during that day.
4. I will send you new instructions the next day.

Is this easy enough? You are part of the first run of this course, so a lot can be improved. Any feedback is appreciated!

Looking forward to hearing "done" from you!

Cheers,
Matej
