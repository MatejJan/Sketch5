You made it!

This is your last email with instructions for #Sketch5!

Steps to do (different than previous days!):
1. No drawing necessary, so you can reply "done" right after you finish reading. You can also work on your sketch some more.
2. I would love to see your final drawing, so include it if you want.

I'll send you one last email as soon as you reply done.

Cheers,
Matej
